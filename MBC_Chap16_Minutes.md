Miraculous Book club chapter 16

**"Situation at this time was beginning to be defined..."**
- sitting with the discordant circumstances between book and today
- there is a 'madness' out there
	- unconscious impulses susceptible to these impulses
	- culture is various 'machines wanting things'
	- remembering both being a part of the bigger picture and remembering that's not as important as the immediate life
	- violation of sacred space of authority is only important as it's defined by this authoritarian culture
	- social murder
	- symbolic / magical gesture of the symbol of taking the capitol
		- moving politics from a RHP format to a LHP position 
		- events of today = black magic
		- using subversive tools to degrade the world
			- using discordian tools against us, beating ourselves with our own severed arm.
- events want to create themselves and group is conscious of this unfolding 'machine'
- decision to stay was a group decision
- process of acceleration, thing happen, "no one believed in words anymore" 
	- the work allows us to have access to this other perspective available for the taking
- reminds back to the initial chapter at the beginning of the war, there's this sense of inevitability 
- How to not get sidetracked into the circus of reality
- is there Aftermath anymore
	- active/passive disorder-bureaucracy is imposed until disorder. collapse, no more a constructed disorder.
	- we're going back to the disorder stage again?
	- difficult to piece down the stages
- life feels faster due to world connections
	- constant, feels unnatural
- life speeding up, closer to a new state

		- but is entertaining this the wrong position?
		- they experience a kind of gnosis of something they perceive as true
		- how do we not become the people at the capitol
			- a 'shock' comes to someone and they mentally break on their ideas
		- So strongly identified with belief
		- people at capitol, identified. it's not that they just believe the thing, but they become the thing.
		- doing something ironically to get a reaction--to the people you do that to, that becomes your identity. once that becomes your identity you get stuck in that role.
		- exercises root out this identification
	- key is as long as you can say to yourself "what a crock of shit" and you get unstuck
- Noah's Arc -- something ideas held for posterity 
	- you may need it later but you don't know when
- G dismissing PDO's breath theory
	- "time is breath" - PDO does a 'back of envelope' ratio, then multiply that ratio 25x and establish arbitrary correspondence
		- oh that sounds right, (but wrong by orders of magnitude)
		- PDO seems starved for contact with G
		- cargo cult mathematics
	- Newton sublimated sexual energy with random maths and accidentally stumbled upon calculus
	- Ramanujan's all integers were his friends, taxi number guy. 
		- bedridden in India

- politics happens faster on the internet
	- seems faster due to more info
	- politics also faster at scale
		- organization can happen quickly
		- political organization used to be close affinity groups, folks in coffee houses
			- bars - people talk about politics all day
		- politics: cocaine period, beer period, lsd period

	- stick apart, important in group decentralization
	- lone wolf terrorism
	- if you're able to leave a group and be in multiple at the same time, your problems with groups minimize with regard to cults.
		- Mormons make it difficult to leave due to embeddedness in the place and culture
	- learn how not to say come be one of us, learn how to say be yourself amongst us - Lee Harrington (Sacred Kink)
	- Founders of discordianism - reps of traditions
		- each of us bring our individual experiences through the group
	- make sure everyone in group, while apart of the group, is also one foot and two arms out of the group so new info flows in
	- diversity 
	- be in multiple bands
		- increases a musical network, a scene
	- fourth way intro groups 
		- see what you can bring to the experience
	- role of discordianism in the strange times is to clergy to the weird in some sense
	- bad faith actors in a group
		- rather than react, refine by asking more questions
		- what is it about them and their madness that defines what had happened to them?
			- is it first ironic, then serious belief?
		- litmus test for group, coming in good faith or not.
