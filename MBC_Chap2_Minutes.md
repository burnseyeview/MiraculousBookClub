# Chapter Two


**G PERSONALITY**
- abrasive G.
- noted moment where G would seem to be trying to convince O he already knew.
- PL Travers who wrote Mary Poppins--was a G disciple. 
    * Mary Poppins was written with a dual personality.
    * Dual forces... informed by G
	
**CRYSTALIZATION**
- The friction between Yes and No
	* Discipline
	* Parent yourself
- From the friction you get a concrete Will that you control rather than other way around.
- How does crystallization compare with PTSD or some other internalized routine
- Is this another way of getting "stuck" but in a functional way?
- You play roles on the outside but your center is solid.
- You still grow within the crystallization, but shift to a more purposeful state.
- There are stages of building up on the crystallization
- Having to tear down the crystallization is painful
- similar to the metaprogramming circuit can make decision on how your mind can work. you want to be in a good "place" to be "ready" for that responsibility.
- distinction between essence and personality
	* babies have a personality before influenced. 
- This streams into alchemical terminology eventually.
	* early mapmaking
	* lead to gold is both a chemical process but also a way of escribing the inner process.


**PRISON**
- if  a  man  in  prison  was  at  any  time  to  have  a  chance  of  escape,  then  he  must  first  of  all  realize that he is in prison. So long as he fails to realize this, so long as he thinks he is free, he has no chance whatever.
- Black Iron Prison metaphor 
	* People stuck in their routines theme
	* Collective--distillation of core message of PD
- RAW same idea, pulled from G 
- Alan Watts stream influenced
- G is "your favorite band's fav band"
- Spiritualist movement around same period contrasts with G's rigorous course

**CARPET SELLER**
- Mythmaking 
- Demonstrates G's practicality 
- The woman who wouldn't take a good price was possessed by the idea of haggling
- The carpet making dance...method of transmitting info via an oral tradition.
	* like an instrument, the tradition is to be developed. Like Jazz
- Medium / message shift from oral to literary. post Gutenberg world. 
- Info changed in order to be written. Needs a logical sequence
- We now view info that way. but the oral trad is not necessarily the same. 
- Guild -- learn by doing
- In the Carpet making dance. everyone is doing their "dance" to make it happen. folk traditions. but also it conveys the knowledge of the carpet making. That's all encoded in the carpet dance.
-Telarus from the chan:
	* Dances are incredibly important in transferring information across generations in indigenous cultures. Anecdotally, the Scotch/Irish people that first encountered Polynesians in the Pacific got along slightly better than their English counterparts because their cultures had "greeting dances" that could be performed when the Hawaiians bust out with their Lua/Hula, etc.
- Body and emotions are encoded in these traditions.
- There's a visceral Human connection to movement
- Body moments can then be use to access that "holy moment"
- Martial Arts
	* Can't be described to replicate
	* A pattern of movement: Juru
		* hunting juru: spear stalking bird in water
		* other juru: head hunters stalk the side of the trail
- When our culture has forgotten it, those patterns are lost
	* Traditions like the Grim Tales to Marvel we pass down this info in our newer mediums
	* social media is the dominant media now. and it's not valued and saved in the same way, discord, fb, subreddits. goal is money and not extending a tradition.
	* Difference when meeting in presence of one another. 
	* G foundation is dependent upon presence. You get full attention. You don't get the same sense over ZOOM.
	* You miss the smell, sound of the room.
	* Buildings that put you in a certain state G found. Churches.
	
**KNOWLEDGE**
- Knowledge is not divisible
- Hidden / Special knowledge and making it available for all
	* To receive you have to want it
	* Knowledge is gained not given.
	* Frames the individual being the one responsible
	* Consider how much we retained from school over all those years
	* Oral tradition doesn't infodump on people either
- Materiality of knowledge.
	* Value of knowledge is related to it's scarcity. The power of the person who has knowledge becomes based on how available it is. 
	* If a Prof invites an expert to talk, there's a better chance the expert will receive more attention due to their role  and reputation.
- Knowledge is a process. 
- A band is a school
- Experiential knowledge
- G: you should never praise children
	* you need to develop in them a sense of agency. to praise you're getting them to work for external approval rather than an inner drive.
	* "You got 100%, how does that feel?" type of question framing.
	* teaching them to live purposefully

**THE FOUR HOUSES**
- expect changeup on this metaphor in the future
- The house metaphor of the self. We're stuck on room 1 but we don't see rooms 2-4
- BIP idea where you break out of one cell but you find yourself in another.
	* A self transcendent of the self and in the end you have a solid "Driver"
- If you take a shortcut the fourth room might be "empty" -- you're not sleeping there because you're not the master yet 
	* Like say through drugs or other transcendent experience
- What does lucidity mean? Do you have to flex it to be aware? and how to preserve an awareness? 
- Brotep's story about reframing his aversions by flipping it on his identity
- Dingo recognizing his own parallel emotions coming out in a different way with his special needs sister. 
- Substitute one explanation to another to change the perspective of the feelings. 
- Confabulation and filling in memory gaps.
- Multiple maps parallel this model:
	* 8-circuit: 3rd circuit person might attribute a stomach ache to something you're thinking about and not what Iâ€™ve eaten.
	* stages of moral development:
		* 1 body afraid of pain/ or food
 		* 2 right/wrong language. symbols
		* 3 spiritual, it's okay to bend the rules when necessary
		* 4 no rules, none matters but skipping step 1 to 4 right to 'nothing matters' can be a problem.	
- Third room person, a yogi might get to room 4, modify things and mess the house up. 
- Nietzsche would after long walks would crumple up in epiphanies...but was syphilis.
- Metaphor: You've inherited the House/Self. Everyone who works in the house is doing the wrong job, butler in the garden, cook is driving the car, etc. waiting for the master to set the house in order--to get your house in order. 
- Disco Elysium (great game writing). 
	* Similar correlation where your skills communicate with you as you progress up.
	

**MACHINES**
- Deleuze and Guattari
- War machines. all things people are involved in are machines
	* Horse + person + spear = war machine
- School = teaching machine: students, pen paper, teacher..
- Unconscious: a smaller version of that same process (see also AoM)
- Passing down knowledge can be difficult because there's no place for that knowledge in the machine we've built.
- If your machine is not intentional, spiritual. 
- Your role can become rote. 
- In the role but not of the role
- G: says you play a role in the world but inside you need to be free
- Authenticity in a role. 
	* work relations and honesty.
	* being open allows others to join you in a space apart from the role.
	* you can be purposeful toward another 
	* the "talk" in "Smalltalk" is small and not the actual message
	* It's a way to have exchange social cues while developing social cred. 

**9/23 Weekly Task:**

- Doorknob task: every touch of a doorknob observe, be aware.
	* high intensity and low intensity tasks tend to be conditions when more likely to forget to do the activity
	* different with a mental vs visceral experience

**9/30 Weekly Task:**
- Who is working in the house?
- As the doorknob was kind of a snap or shock to the routine, include the following steps.
	* After coming back to the body in that moment, check on each room in the house. 
	* See if you can feel the individual streams of the physical, emotional, and intellectual.
	* how are the 4(8)- circuits operating?
