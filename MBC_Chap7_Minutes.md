**LAW OF OCTAVES**
- Gurdjieff introduces scale of hidden knowledge. seven note scale
- esoteric knowledge introduced here. with hermetic thought, alchemy
	- newton: rainbow as 7 colors to match the law of octaves 
	- not first physicist but last alchemist ;)
	- a thing needs to seem complete with these 7 steps
	- sol is first new note in common series
	- common note to modulate to in 60s
	- a doubling of modulation 
	- a string vibes neighboring string at twice the frequency do to DO
	- an octave feels the same 'softest' interval 
	- do DO SOL, 1, 8, 5. but a third of each frequency
	- two branching points on the octave
		- mathematical predictable notes but with semitones.
		- what sounds good is somewhat off if you match the frequencies
		- DO -initial burst of energy, discordian chaos. first note of the scale
		- move through the "rainbow" 
		- these two intervals are where things get off track
			- in a project there's points where you may lose energy. stalling out. beginning and end. 
				- at these points they need an energy boost
				- law of 7 is a recognition where there are places where things naturally decay. may move off course. maybe it needs to?
				- without bring conscious energy into it it loses that energy
				- semitones are where you get your dissonance from.
					- mi to fa, and si to do. points where you resolve in harmony
					- in fa or mi needs to move in the other direction so tension can be released or harmony can be done.
				- cybernetic metaphor: phase transition. 
					- mechanism creates heat
					- container
					- thermal element
					- if you put ice in the container the ice melts. you expect the temp will go up but it doesn’t. the temp actually drops a bit and then it goes up . when it boils it goes down then up. the structure change absorbs this energy for structure change. you lose a bit of energy with the transfer. people try to apply this logic to say social phenom. 
					 graphing how many likes
						- "S" curve where it dips and goes up and dips and goes up again because things fundamentally change there.

**SELF REMEMBERING**
- you can’t do anything when your SR but you only remember when you SR?

	- aware of inner world and external
	- 5e concentration spell

		- sol as sun...making it the New do. first "New" Do.
		- an "A" is 440, 880...doubles
		- do re mi fa. mi to fa when notes are closer 
			- sound wave up and down. two sound waves can cancel each other out. add the two waveforms together
			- one tone but double the loudness. lot of rough sound....LOOKS rough more spike, more wigglyness. more complex. 
		- Gurdjieff make music? -- played a hand organ
			- He composed G music. Thomas de Hartmann. 
		- How does this relate to SR?
			- in chapter 9 but more confusing
			- journey between 0 and 1, cycle of creation, the Tarot: fool to world, a cosmic patter
			- story of universe is note do to Do 
			- re is all the galaxies
			- descends until the moon. final note of the scale.
				- organic life on earth is needed to advance life on earth.
				- final phase of creation something needs to be guided to next destination
				- organic life serves to keep creation moving 
				- journey to individual consciousness as playing in the roles of universe
				- earth is moving along in this blind sleeping tumultuous way...wars, shit, etc. 
					- appearance of consciousness
					- Eris "then stop"
	- Cruising moments
		- and then there's brief moments of clarity
			- like a menu screen of options...
				- savvy of the programs you're running
			- of the dead matter some became "self"
				- universe attempt to know itself?
				- "wants" to but too distracted
			- when we die, become dead matter
				- ego death, self not existing is always continuously there. 
					- natural state of things...then you go back into the things
